Add-ons and Recommended Mods

Add-on: Westerado Wilderness, overhauls biomes to have more of a western-feel, including many new plants
Add-on: Westerado Gunslinger, adds compatibility with Combat Extended
Add-on: Horses by SpiderCamp, adds horses!
Recommended: Snowy Trees by Nandonalt and Tejko, plants get snowy when it snows

Mod loading order
Westerado The Gun Jesus Revelations should be loaded after Westerado (Core), if you're using Snowy Trees by Nandonalt and Tejko put that before Westerado (Core) and Westerado WIlderness. Something like:

Westerado Wilderness
Westerado Gunslinger
